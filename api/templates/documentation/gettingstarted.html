    <p class="mx-2">First, you need a token, therefore you need to purchase this service: open a ticket in our Discord to do so. You will have your ticket in our dashboard. To use the API all you need to do is make a request in your prefered language.<br><br>Python Example:</p>
    <pre><code>
        # SOON
    </code></pre>
