    <p class="mx-3">sAPI uses Authorization Tokens to authorize requests. You can view your token in our dashboard.<br><br>Users are given a token after paying for a subscription (check out our Sellix, and after purchasing you will be given a key: enter that key in our dashboard) and they are revoked if the user decides to cancel his subscription or the user does not follow our rules. Your token carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! Do not share your secret token in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.</p>

    <h3>Authorizing a request</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="mx-3">To authorize a request, you need to add an <code>Authorization</code> header in your request with the following value: <code>Token yourtoken</code>, where <code>yourtoken</code> is the token visible in our dashboard. If this is confusing, check our Examples section for a better understanding.</p>
