# Something API

Something API is a REST API made in Python, using Django REST Framework. The main concept of it is that there are going to be many features that would help other developers in creating their projects. I will mainly focus on image manipulation, animals and utilities. This project stands out from the rest because it will use many more pictures and it will be much more useful than any other API currently on the market. You will be able to use this API to do the work of 10 other APIs.

**this readme will be improved while I work on the project**
